# Flight Delay Analysis

This project analyzes flight delays in the United States based on various factors, including the day of the week, month, and cause of delay. The analysis is conducted using a dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. It provides detailed information on flight delays, including causes and durations. You can download the dataset directly from the BTS website using the link below:

## Slideshow Presentation

To visualize the findings of this analysis, a slideshow presentation has been created. This presentation provides a detailed overview of the data analysis, including graphs and insights on flight delays by year, month, day, and cause.

## Key Findings

- **Day of the Week**: The maximum proportion of flights delayed is on Fridays (21.4%), while the minimum occurs on Saturdays.
- **Month**: December has the highest percentage of delayed flights at 23.2%.
- **Causes of Delay**: The majority of delays are due to late-arriving aircraft, followed by carrier delays.
